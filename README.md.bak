# **Distinct cross-regional control of amygdalar dynamics reliably reflects fear memory age**

- For the analysis from Figure 1 ~ 3, please check the folder `Correlation_and_Modulation_Analysis`.
- For the LightGBM analysis using non-freezing or freezing data, go to `MemoryAge_WinLen_5_Step_0.5` or `MemoryAge_WinLen_5_Step_0.5_FREEZING_ONLY` for details.
- For the Transformer analysis using non-freezing or freezing data, go to `MemoryAge_Transformer_xLARGE` or `MemoryAge_Transformer_xLARGE_using_FREEZING_ONLY`. We acknowledge that we use the backbone IO strategy in TorchEEG, [TorchEEG](https://github.com/torcheeg/torcheeg).
